THE EQUALIZER (FairPlay AI) - PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
   The Equalizer is an AI-powered rights advocate designed to democratize legal and bureaucratic assistance. 
   Core Value: Interpreting complex fine print, identifying risks, and taking formal action for the user.
   Key Technologies: Gemini 3 (Long-context, Multimodal), Multilingual Voice AI.

2. ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK
   
   A. AI & Reasoning Layer (The Brain)
      - Model: Gemini 3 (or latest Gemini Ultra/Pro 1.5 variants).
      - Capabilities: 
        - Long Context: For reading entire insurance policies or government codebooks.
        - Multimodal: For scanning physical letters/bills via camera.
      - Framework: LangChain or Google Vertex AI Agent Builder.

   B. Voice Interaction Layer (The Interface)
      - Speech-to-Text (STT): Google Cloud STT or OpenAI Whisper (fine-tuned for accents).
      - Text-to-Speech (TTS): ElevenLabs or Google Cloud TTS for natural, empathetic voice output in native languages.

   C. Backend (The Nervous System)
      - Language: Python (FastAPI or Django).
      - Database: PostgreSQL (User data), Vector DB (Pinecone/Milvus) for retrieving relevant legal precedents/templates.
      - Document Parsing: OCR (Tesseract/Google Vision API) for non-digitized mail.

   D. Frontend (The Body)
      - Mobile App (Recommended): Flutter or React Native. (Crucial for "pocket" accessibility).
      - Web Dashboard: React.js for managing complex cases.

3. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

   PHASE 1: PROTOTYPE & CORE LOGIC (Weeks 1-4)
   - Goal: Validate document understanding and simplification.
   - Tasks:
     1. Setup Gemini API with system prompts designed for "Legal Analyst" persona.
     2. Build "Risk Detector" module: Input PDF -> Output List of Risks (High/Medium/Low).
     3. Build "Simplifier" module: Input Legalese -> Output 5th-grade reading level summary.

   PHASE 2: THE VOICE ASSISTANT (Weeks 5-8)
   - Goal: Enable conversational interaction.
   - Tasks:
     1. Implement streaming audio support. User speaks -> STT -> LLM (Reasoning) -> TTS -> Audio.
     2. Add "Mother Tongue" support. distinct prompts for translation to ensure local dialect accuracy.

   PHASE 3: THE ACTION ENGINE (Weeks 9-12)
   - Goal: Transition from advice to action.
   - Tasks:
     1. Create template library (Appeals, Contest Letters, clarification requests).
     2. Build "Document Generator": LLM fills templates with specific case details found in the analysis.
     3. Implement export features (PDF generation, Email drafts).

   PHASE 4: REFINEMENT & COMPLIANCE (Weeks 13+)
   - Security: Implement PII (Personally Identifiable Information) masking pipeline.
   - Legal Disclaimers: Ensure "Not Legal Advice" guardrails are robust.
   - User Testing: Focus on non-English speakers for usability.

4. KEY FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

   - "Snap & Truth": User takes a photo of a bill; AI highlights overcharges immediately.
   - "Guardian Mode": Voice assistant listens to a service call (e.g., with an ISP) and suggests what to say in real-time.
   - "One-Click Appeal": Generate a formal contest letter for parking tickets or unfair fees ready to print/email.

5. NEXT STEPS
   1. Initialize git repository.
   2. Creates `requirements.txt` for Python backend.
   3. Acquire API keys for Gemini and chosen Voice providers.
   4. Begin Phase 1: Create the basic analysis script.
